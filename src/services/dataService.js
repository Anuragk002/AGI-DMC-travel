      "Located 57 storeys up from the heart of the Marina Bay area, the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck boasts scenic views of the panoramic vistas of Marina Bay and Singapore’s world-class cityscape. Take in a bird’s-eye view of Gardens by the Bay and the impressive Supertree Grove, or admire the sea view that stretches from Marina South Pier to the Singapore Strait.\n\nFrom above, try your hand at spotting Singapore’s iconic landmarks. Look out for the capsules on the Singapore Flyer and the durian-shaped domes of the Esplanade – or the Merlion statue, another major tourist attraction in Singapore. Be sure to also keep an eye out for the orange-tiled roofs of the shophouses along the Singapore River.\n\nIf you’re a guest of the Hotel, take a luxurious dip in the Infinity Pool – the iconic rooftop Singapore pool, which offers spectacular views of the city at sunset. After, head down to the Event Plaza to catch Spectra, the free outdoor light and water show that takes place nightly on the Waterfront Promenade.\n\nCap off your day at some of the best restaurants and bars in the Marina Bay area. Try the Michelin-starred CUT by Wolfgang Puck, feast on a stacked CrazyShake at Black Tap Craft Burgers and Beer, then stop for a handcrafted cocktail at AVENUE Singapore or LAVO Italian Restaurant & Rooftop Bar.",

      "AJ Hackett International, the company responsible for the adrenaline rush of more than four million people around the world is in Singapore!\n\nSingapore’s first and only bungy tower stands 50m above the ground on Siloso Beach, Sentosa Island. The site features the Skybridge, a 40m walkway with see-through sections. On it, is the Paulaner Sundowner Deck, which has the best sunset views in Siloso.\n\nThrill-seekers then have the choice of doing the drop and swoop on the Giant Swing, or challenge themselves on the 47m Bungy Jump.\n\nFor those who prefer not to tempt fate, food and beverages are served al fresco, which is open daily, from 10am onwards. Siloso’s new landmark is also the perfect spot to grab a cold one by the beach. Function areas are available for MICE, gatherings, parties, and other special events.",

We like to say “it’s where the future is created”.\n\nOur striking lotus-inspired building, designed by Moshe Safdie, features 21 gallery spaces spanning nearly 5000m2. Since opening in February 2011, we have held large-scale exhibitions by some of the world’s best known artists including Leonardo da Vinci, Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Vincent Van Gogh and M.C. Escher. In addition, we have presented significant exhibitions that explore aspects of science including big data, particle physics, paleontology, marine biology, cosmology and space exploration.\n\nThe museum has staged international exhibitions in partnership with renowned museums and galleries from around the world including the British Museum and Science Museum in London; the American Museum of Natural History, New York; the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan; the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; the Australian Centre for Moving Image, Melbourne and many other institutions. We also originate and produce exhibitions in-house and run a full programme of education, events, performances, screenings and learning opportunities for a wide range of audiences.\n\nArtScience Museum is owned and operated by Marina Bay Sands.

Singapore’s history as a port city that brought people together from all over the world is used as a means of examining the history of Asia. Special exhibitions bring magnificent objects from around the world to our Singapore audience.

Whatever you do, though, ensure that you get to spend plenty of time at the aquarium's centerpiece display, the Open Ocean Habitat, featuring a viewing panel measuring 36 meters in width and 8.3 meters in height – a spectacular window into a serene blue world teeming with marine animals including manta rays and giant groupers as well as schools of fish, truly replicating what the deep ocean looks like.

      "<h2>Why You Should Get On Board</h2>\n<p>While it is difficult to discover all of Singapore’s wonderful landmarks in a few days, this hop-on hop-off ticket gets you as close as possible to achieving this feat. You have 3 different routes and 3 attraction shuttles to choose from, each with its own unique sights, and more than 40 stops that you can potentially visit. </p>\n<p>You can begin your tour from any of the 40 different stops. A suggested itinerary is as follows: You could begin your tour by visiting the Botanic Gardens, which opens early at 9.50 AM. Following the yellow line will take you through the many iconic hotels such as Rendezvous Hotel, Marriott Hotel, and Orchard Hotel. You can also visit the Singapore Art Museum and the City Hall.

          "<h2>Why You Shouldn’t Miss This</h2>\n<p>Singapore is a tropical country with its typical weather, which is probably the reason Snow City is so popular. It gives people a chance to beat the heat in a very novel way. The Snow City located at the Science Centre allows people to experience snow and cold weather. Coupled with its Inuit theme and multiple attractions like the 60m long snow slide, fun house for children, playgrounds, and fields, it becomes clear that the Snow City is a unique experience that will leave you with fun and cheerful memories.</p>\n<h2>Your Experience</h2>\n<p>Once you enter the Snow City, you will need to put on the jacket and boots to enter the actual snow chamber. If you are not used to low temperatures, you may want to rent some gloves as well. Once you are inside the snow chamber, you can visit any of the four zones inside. You can start from the Artic Snow Playground where you will learn about the Inuit way of life, and then move on to the snow field, and the snow slide. You can find photographers ready to record your memories with your friends and family so that you can relive your experiences long after you leave.</p>",

      "<h2>Why You Shouldn’t Miss This</h2>\n<p>AJ Hackett, a name that is synonymous with adrenaline is a one-of-a-kind adrenaline based theme park. After satisfying more than 4 million people globally, this international brand has now come to Singapore. AJ Hackett Sentosa hosts Singapore’s one and only Bungy Jump, The park also offers a unique Giant Swing Experience, and more which allows you to literally conquer gravity and get rid of your fear of vertigo. So come on down and pump in the adrenaline into your blood and have a thrilling adventure unlike anything Singapore has to offer. The venue is perfect for friend groups and people who are looking for some excitement in their lives. Oh, you can also grab a beer and enjoy some exceptional food here!</p>\n<h3>Bungy Jump</h3>\n<p>Singapore’s only Bungy jump, this activity is what led to the company gaining an international reputation. All you need to do is get upto a height of 47 meters, harness yourself in the straps and fall; gravity will do the rest. Don’t worry, the experience is 100% safe and you’re guaranteed an adrenaline rush as the wind rushes through your face. A true thrill-seekers attraction, the Bungy Jump is fascinating for both the jumper and the spectator. </p>\n<h3>Giant Swings</h3>\n<p>The only dual swings in the world; hop aboard the giant swings and reach speeds of up to 120 km/hr; that’s as fast as most cars on roads. Get on from the ground level and rise to a height of 40 meters. This attraction allows you to do something that most adrenaline based activities do not; a race with your friends. The Giant Swings allow a maximum combined weight(among three people max) of 240 kg per swing. Hop on and begin a race with your friends and see who reaches the bottom first on this one-of-a-kind activity which you can’t do anywhere else on the planet.</p>\n<h3>Skybridge</h3>\n<p>A 2-meter wide transparent glass flooring platform, the Skybridge is perfect for getting over your fear of vertigo. This section is 40 meters long and is located at a height of 47 meters with 1.2-meter high handrails for your support. Walk along this incredible bridge and get 360-degree panoramic views of Singapore all around you. There’s no need for any harnessing system allowing you to casually walk across the length at your own pace. There’s also a challenging glass cube located on the Skybridge which will make your knees tremble. Excited already? Well here’s the best part, with the theme park being located at the beach, your views will go on till the horizon.</p>",

Once the voucher voucher is redeemed at the vouchering counter at Singapore Zoo, however, you must use the vouchers within the same day.

Located on Mandai Lake Road, the venue is easily accessible by cars and metro alike. Take the Red line and transit to a connecting bus, preferably route no 927 or no 138.\n<br><br></p>\n<h3>Pro Tip:</h3>\n<p>Make the most of your combo vouchers by giving these attractions the time they deserve and visiting each park on a different day to fully explore all the sights within.</p>\n<p>However, should you wish to visit all the parks on the same day, we recommend that you begin with Singapore Zoo since it closes earlier and is the largest of the three parks. Once you've explored the Zoo to your heart's content, feel free to move on to the River Safari to enjoy your two boat rides and finish your day on your fascinating Night Safari!</p>",

At the same time, we take you on a fun history trail to visit other iconic landmarks, experience local cultures and learn about the amazing transformation journey of Singapore!\n\nPlease find the itinerary below:\nSingapore Art Museum (Main Entrance)\n- Starting Point. Meet and great with your local guide.\n\nCHIJMES\n- Known as the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus back then, CHIJMES has since evolved into a heritage building that houses many dining options. The Gothic-style chapel has also been repurposed into a function hall where weddings are a common sight - including Colin and Araminta's lavish wedding scene!\n\nRaffles Hotel\n- Having housed many notable personalities from Queen Bey to Queen Elizabeth, it's no wonder that the Raffles Hotel was chosen as Rachel and Nick's home away from home during their stay in Singapore.\n\nAnderson Bridge\n- This is one scene that's hard to swallow. Here, Astrid finally confronted her husband Michael about his affair while they were on the way to Collin's wedding but things backfired and Michael stomped out of the car.\n\nAsian Civilisation Museum\n- After the eventful night at Gardens by the Bay, Nick met up with Rachel and eventually bent the knee to propose to her. Though she rejected him here, she eventually accepted him at the end of the movie!\n\nMarina Bay Sands\n- After Rachel finally accepted Nick's proposal just before she left for New York, they went for their grand engagement party @ Marina Bay Sands and basically had a celebration so grand we almost thought it was New Year's eve.\n\nGardens by the Bay\n- Who knew that we were allowed to hold a wedding dinner by the Supertree Grove @ Gardens by the Bay? We can't even image how much the location rental would have even cost.... but hey, it looks amazing and we'd die to just be invited to a dinner party here.",

      'Come and discover Singapore’s new botanical wonder, the Gardens by the Bay, a breathtaking horticultural paradise and cutting-edge green space built on land reclaimed from the sea.<br />\n<br />\nBay South Garden, which was opened to the public in 2012, is the largest of the three gardens, with its 54 hectares showcasing the best of tropical horticulture and garden artistry. Make your way to the two cooled conservatories situated along the edge of the Marina Reservoir: the Flower Dome, featuring plants from the Mediterranean and other semi-arid tropical regions, including thousand year-old olive trees, baobabs and cacti; and the Cloud Forest, which replicates the conditions found in tropical mountain regions and features orchids, ferns, pitcher plants and many other species besides. It even boasts a 35-metre man-made mountain and waterfall.<br />\n<br />\nThen it’s time to step outside to explore the Supertree Grove. The Supertrees are colossal tree-like structures, each with vertical gardens, ranging in height between 25 and 50 metres. Don’t miss the stunning bird’s eye view to be had from the 22-metre high Skyway linking two of the tallest Supertrees. In the evening, when darkness falls, the Supertrees come to life with a spectacular light and sound show at 7:45pm and 8:45pm nightly. Round off your visit by picking up some souvenirs at one of the three garden shops. The tour ends here and there is no drop off back to the hotel.<br />\n<br />\nFor the Christmas flyer click <a href="http://media.activitiesbank.com/27194/ENG/CHRISTMAS_FLYER.pdf" target="_blank"> here.</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>End/closing time</strong><br />\n<font face="Arial">You can stay in the gardens for as long as you like.</font><!--EndFragment -->',

Must-see highlights include a pair of resident giant pandas and a recreation of the Amazonian rainforest submerged in floodwater.<br />\n<br />\nOccupying over 12 hectares of land, River Safari recreates eight freshwater ecosystems from around the world including the Nile, the Yangtze, the Mississippi, the Congo and the Ganges. Here you will encounter a host of species, many endangered in the wild, such as anacondas, electric eels, Mekong freshwater stingrays, giant catfish and Chinese alligators. Stroll through freshwater galleries and enter walk-through exhibits to learn about the fascinating flora and fauna of river habitats. With ‘Express Access’, you won’t have to wait in line to catch giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia in the 1,500 square-metre Giant Panda Forest, the largest panda exhibit in Southeast Asia. Also sharing this climate-controlled biodome are the rare red pandas and elegant golden pheasants. Check out the Amazon Flooded Forest exhibit which, with its 2,000 cubic metres of water, boasts of being the largest freshwater aquarium in the world, while the Frozen Tundra exhibit simulates an Arctic habitat and is home to Inuka, a polar bear.<br />\n<br />\nThe river is calling … begin your journey of discovery at River Safari today.

      "Venture into the wild on this Safari double whammy. Join us to explore both Singapore’s River Safari and the Night Safari – the very first Night Safari in the world! Forget the notion that Singapore is all high-tech, skyscrapers and metropolitan city life; on these safaris you will feel as if in the midst of an Asian rainforest.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the duration of the tour, you will at all times be accompanied by an enthusiastic guide who will tell you all the jungle facts and tales. To begin, the River Safari takes you through one of the world’s single largest repositories for river critters. On this trip you will encounter all sorts of creatures: large and small; mammal, reptile and amphibian; water dwellers and land dwellers…; all of this amidst splendorous imitations of some of the world’s most famous rivers.<br />\n<br />\nLater on, when darkness falls, the time has arrived to hit the Night Safari. While riding a comfortable Tram, spot some magnificent nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. Fearsome predators and humble herbivores coexist side by side under the glassy glow of the moon. Do not worry about losing track of them or not spotting any in the dark: your well-trained guide can point out all the creatures in the surroundings.<br />\n<br />\nAs you return to the city to hit the sack, you will feel as if you are stepping out of a dream. It is amazing how jungle environments can exist so near a thriving metropolis like Singapore.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Languages</strong><br />\nEnglish.",

      "Singapore Zoo is spread over 28 hectares and is a haven to a host of mammals, birds and reptiles including many rare and endangered species. Natural barriers like streams, rock walls and beautiful landscaping are used to separate the animals from visitors thus creating an ‘open zoo’ effect. Marvel at the rare white tigers and thrill at the largest captive colony of orang-utans in the world.<br />\n<br />\nAmong the varied shows and attractions, you can choose from ‘Breakfast with an Orang-utan’, which allows visitors to interact with this fascinating and highly intelligent member of the ape family; ‘Elephants at Work and Play’, which demonstrates how elephants have been used as beasts of burden in south-east Asian countries; and ‘Splash Safari’, which showcases the zoo’s aquatic mammals and birds. For younger visitors there’s Rainforest Kidzworld, where they can splash around in a watery playground, spend time with farmyard animals and take a rainforest challenge.<br />\n<br />\nA morning of fun for all the family awaits you at the endlessly surprising Singapore Zoo.",

      "This Singapore bike tour shows you the best of the city’s sights, all aboard two wheels! Zip through the city via the biggest cultural enclave, where new and old converge. Experience the oldest residential zone, where British-era buildings still stand. Ride along the beautiful and historical Singapore River and learn how it was the heart of the city’s commercial development. We’ve crammed it all into this epic ride!<br />\n<br />\nAlong the way, we’ll take a break to stretch our legs, and you’ll have the option of sipping some local coffee, or cooling off with a glass of refreshing calamansi juice (a local treat similar to lemonade). We’ll also refuel with a delectable local snack such as kaya toast (bread or crackers topped with a mix of coconut milk, butter, and sugar).<br />\n<br />\nOur biking adventure will include a visit to the cultural enclave of Kampong Glam, a historic district where Malays and Arabs once settled. We’ll zip through the nooks and crannies, where rows of boutique shops and Middle Eastern cafés beckon locals. You’ll have lots of opportunities to stop and snap photos, and you’ll hear intriguing stories (with a bit of trivia!) from your local expert guide. From there, we’ll explore Bussorah Street, often referred to as Little Istanbul. Here, you’ll find many Turkish diners and shops selling souvenirs.<br />\n<br />\nAs the morning heat builds up, we’ll take a respite from the sun by cooling off at the Malay Heritage Centre. Here we can top up our water bottles with ice-cold water from the cooler provided.<br />\n<br />\nOur bike tour will continue along Beach Road, which was once the coastline of the city but has since been pushed inland to accommodate land being reclaimed for buildings and businesses. Imagine, almost 13,000 football fields’ worth of land has been reclaimed since the 1960s!<br />\n<br />\nAs we cycle, we can marvel over the architecture along the coastline, where many of the buildings were built based on Chinese feng shui. We’ll eventually reach the famous Raffles Hotel, which is the jewel in the crown of our hotels in Singapore. It’s also home to the beloved Singapore sling — a pineapple cocktail made with gin. This 128-year-old building was once a bungalow by the beach, visited by many famous people, including Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Jackson.<br />\n<br />\nWe’ll finish up our Singapore tour with a visit to the colonial district, where you can see buildings that remind you of the old British rule. For the grand finale we’ll catch a glimpse of the beautiful waterfront at Marina Bay, including the spectacular Marina Bay Sands — a resort that cost a whopping USD 5.7 billion to build.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Languages</strong><br />\nEnglish<br />\n ",

      "At night, Chinatown comes alive with light, fun and joie de vivre. The patterns, aromas and colours that mix and mingle in this part of town give its many shops and eateries an unparalleled personality, not to be found elsewhere in Singapore.<br />\n<br />\nOf course, Chinatown is not short on culture either. On this tour you will wander along the narrow lanes of the Night Market and test your bargaining skills against street vendors selling anything from souvenirs to leather goods.<br />\n<br />\nEnjoy a traditional dinner of the finest Chinese cuisine at a local restaurant before rambling off into the Night Market’s narrow lanes. Here, put your haggling skills to the test at any of the many picturesque stands.<br />\n<br />\nAfter that, the time has arrived for an exciting ride on a trishaw through Chinatown’s labyrinthine alleys towards Clarke Quay. Once there, hop off the trishaw and onto another unconventional form of transport: a bumboat. Cruise the Singapore River for a magnificent vantage point of the city’s night lights, restored shop houses, cosmopolitan skyscrapers and even its financial district, colonial buildings and the renowned Merlion statue. It will be a night to remember.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Languages</strong><br />\nEnglish",
